    "- Lastly, with the help of Foursquare we will retrieve data for the restaurants on every ward and we will use it to compare each one of them and divide them into different klusters using K-means methods, so deppending on your tastes you will be able to know which wards are going to reward you with your favourite food. We will also obtain data from leaflet with the library folium so we can display a nice visualization map.\n"
